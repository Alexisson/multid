You need at least 1 argument (identifier length) to use the function. The second argument by default passes options for the identifier:
1. little: (the default is true), the identifier will include lowercase characters.
2. capital: (default is false), the identifier will include uppercase characters.
3. numbers: (default is false), the identifier will include numbers.
The function returns an identifier with the length specified in the first argument and options, if specified. If no options are specified, the identifier with the length specified in the first argument and in uppercase will be returned.
